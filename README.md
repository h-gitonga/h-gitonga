👋 Hi, I'm Humphrey Gitonga

Clinician | Machine Learning | Oncology & Healthcare Data

🧠 About Me

I am a clinician focused on applying machine learning and data science methods to healthcare data, with a particular interest in oncology, predictive modeling, and clinical decision support.

My work sits at the intersection of medicine and data, where I explore how statistical and machine learning techniques can be used to uncover patterns, support risk stratification, and inform better health decisions.

This GitHub profile highlights selected projects that demonstrate my approach to healthcare data analysis and model development.

🔧 Technical Focus
Python, SQL, pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib/seaborn, Jupyter notebooks, TensorFlow(ML)

📂 Featured Work

Projects showcased here focus on applying machine learning techniques to real-world healthcare datasets. Current work includes regression-based modeling in non-oncology domains, with methods intended to be transferable to oncology and broader clinical applications.
